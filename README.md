# Katsumi
One of the best upcoming Discord Nukers/Raiders! Made in Python.

## How-To
1. Make sure you have an empty dictionary `{}` in your `settings.json` file and `tokens.json` file that will be in the same directory as `main.py`
2. Make sure that you add every token through the nuker itself

## Bot Accounts
1. If you're making a bot account, make sure it has every privileged intent enabled for proper functionality!
