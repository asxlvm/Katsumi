# Katsumi
One of the best free nukers! Made with Python

## How-To
1. Make sure you have an empty dictionary `{}` in your `settings.json` file that will be in the same directory as `main.py`
2. Make sure that every token is **EITHER** in `tokens.txt` (each token on a new line) or in a .env file in a list like this: `TOKENS=["token1","token2"]` and if it is in the .env make sure to set `envList` to `True` in `main.py`
