# Katsumi
One of the best upcoming Discord Nukers/Raiders! Made in Python.

## How-To
1. Make sure you have an empty dictionary `{}` in your `settings.json` file and `tokens.json` file that will be in the same directory as `main.py`
2. Make sure that you add every token through the nuker itself

## Bot Accounts
1. If you're making a bot account, make sure it has every privileged intent enabled for proper functionality!

## TODO:
1. Try to make every bot in another loop
2. !stopnuke command that maxes out every counter and sets it to 0 in a while
3. !close command that kills every bot loop
4. !serverinfonuke that changes server picture and name
5. !nuke command that does every nuke possible
